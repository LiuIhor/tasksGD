About

Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also 
known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you 
the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best 
strategy quickly. Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

About

Create your own search engine! It probably won’t compete with Google: yours 
will be a simple version which processes some data and searches it for a word or 
a phrase. Simple but cool.

About

Blockchains are data structures where blocks are inseparably connected. What 
makes blockchains so special is the security level they offer due to the way 
they are constructed. Blockchains are unhackable, so it makes perfect sense 
why cryptocurrency makes use of this technology. In this project, you will try 
yourself at making a microcosm where virtual miners earn cryptocurrency and 
exchange messages and transactions using blockchain. As difficult as the project 
might be, it is bound to pay off: not in cryptocurrency, but in knowledge and 
skills.
